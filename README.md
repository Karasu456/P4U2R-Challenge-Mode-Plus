# Mission Overview


## No. 01 - Auto Combo
In Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, the player can perform a full combo using a singular button. To showcase the game's simplest combo route, I've dedicated the first trial to it.

## No. 02 - Special Moves
In the game's original Challenge Mode, special moves are spread across multiple trials. Thus, removing the extra room to showcase more combo routes or character-specific mechanics. Because of this, I decided to condense the Special moves & subsequent SP moves trials into one.

## No. 03 - SP Moves
As previously stated, SP moves are originally spread across multiple trials. So to reduce the amount of wasted trials, I've condensed the SP moves trials into one trial.

## No. 04 - Instant Kill
When a player is up a round within a match, they unlock access to their instant kill move upon entering awakening. So to showcase this, I've decided to keep the game's original trial to do so.

![Instant Kill]()

## No. 05 - Character Showcase I
Due to notable mechanical differences that exist from character to character, the Character Showcase trials demonstrate a staple combo or gameplay mechanics for their character. These two trials are rather free-form, so you'll find that they will vary greatly.

![Character Showcase I]()

## No. 06 - Character Showcase II
As previously mentioned, the Character Showcase trials show different gameplay mechanics or a core combo for the character. Because of this, we can introduce core concepts for how a character can play

![Character Showcase II]()

## No. 07 - Midscreen I
Now that we've covered the more basic concepts for a character's toolkit, we can now move on to where our combos are. To start them off, we'll go with two midscreen routes that work just about anywhere.

![Midscreen I]()

## No. 08 - Midscreen II
Similar to Midscreen I, Midscreen II is an easier route that will generally work just about anywhere.

## No. 09 - Corner I
With different stage positioning, such as facing the corner, characters are often given much more combo ability to extend their usual routes. Corner I is an easier route to showcase the unique game state of corner-specific routes.

![Corner I]()

## No. 10 - Corner II
Similar to Corner I, Corner II is an easier route that will only work in the corner.

![Corner II]()

## No. 11 - Defensive Options
As a short break for more complex trials, these trials will showcase the defensive tools that a character can use. These tools are their Furious Action(aka Dragon Punch, "DP"), Guard Cancel & Guard Cancel Evasive Action, Reversal Burst, & Reversal Supers, where applicable.

![Defensive Options]()

## No. 12 - Metered Throw
Depending on the character, you may be required to spend meter to extend a landed throw into a combo. This metered extension can be in the form of an SP move or a One More Cancel, a rapid cancel that removes the recovery from another move. To universalize the route, characters that don't require meter to extend the combo will use the meter to finish the route.

## No. 13 - Air to Air
When countering an opponent's aerial approach, it's often good to react with an aerial attack yourself. These routes will showcase how you can confront this aerial approach with an aerial ladder or with a grounded combo route on a Counter Hit.

![Air to Air]()

## No. 14 - Anti-Air
As the name implies, these trials are dedicated to using a grounded anti-air starter. This is a good countermeasure to have against aerial opponents as the reward can be rather beneficial due to the typically stronger combo starter. 

![Anti_Air]()

## No. 15 - All Out Attack(Launch)
Using the game's universal overhead attack, All Out Attack, we can showcase combo routes to both follow-ups. This trial is dedicated to the Launch variant, which sends the opponent into the air after pressing the 'C' button. Thus, allowing for an aerial ladder route.

![All Out Attack(Launch)]()

## No. 16 - All Out Attack(Blowback)
As previously explained, the game's universal overhead attack, All Out Attack, has two different follow-ups. This trial is dedicated to the Blowback variant, which sends the opponent back from where you hit them. When landing this starter in the corner, you can get a full combo after timing the Blowback hit correctly to force a Fatal Counter.

![All Out Attack(Blowback)]()

## No. 17 - Midscreen III
After covering most of the basics, we can now showcase more difficult, yet more damaging, combo routes to showcase more of a character's toolkit. Next, we'll continue with two midscreen routes that work just about anywhere.

![Midscreen III]()

## No. 18 - Midscreen IV
Similar to Midscreen III, Midscreen IV is a more difficult, but more rewarding, route that will generally work just about anywhere.

![Midscreen IV]()

## No. 19 - Corner III
Similar to the previously explored corner-specific routing in Corner I & II, Corner III & IV will do the same with more difficult, yet more damaging routes. These routes will only work in the corner due to their interaction with the stage's wall.

![Corner III]()

## No. 20 - Corner IV
Similar to Corner III, Corner IV is a more difficult, but more rewarding, route that will only work in the corner.

![Corner IV]()

## No. 21 - Forced Fatal I
When landing a Counter hit against an opponent, the state of the Counter can be altered based on a few different things. The first of which is the initial attack used to begin the combo. Some moves have the property to force a Fatal Counter, which includes added hitstun and opens up new combo links. The second is the status ailment of Fear, which allows for a Fatal Counter on any hit regardless of the attack being a proper Counter hit. And third, is what's known as a Fatal Recovery, but we'll explain this further later on.
