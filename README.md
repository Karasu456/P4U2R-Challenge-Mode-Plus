# Mission Overview


## No. 01 - Auto Combo
In Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, the player can perform a full combo using a singular button. This is an auto combo, which can be performed by repeatedly pressing the 'A' button.

## No. 02 - Special Moves
In the game's original Challenge Mode, special moves are spread across multiple trials. Thus, removing the extra room to showcase more combo routes or character-specific mechanics. Because of this, I decided to condense the Special moves & subsequent SP moves trials into one.

## No. 03 - SP Moves
As previously stated, SP moves are originally spread across multiple trials. So to reduce the amount of wasted trials, I've condensed the SP moves trials into one trial.

## No. 04 - Instant Kill
When a player is up a round within a match, they unlock access to their instant kill move upon entering awakening. So to showcase this, I've decided to keep the game's original trial to do so.

![Instant Kill](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/InstantKill.gif)

## No. 05 - Character Showcase I
Due to notable mechanical differences that exist from character to character, the Character Showcase trials demonstrate a staple combo or gameplay mechanics for their character. These two trials are rather free-form, so you'll find that they will vary greatly.

![Character Showcase I](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/CharacterShowcaseI.gif)

## No. 06 - Character Showcase II
As previously mentioned, the Character Showcase trials show different gameplay mechanics or a core combo for the character. Because of this, we can introduce core concepts for how a character can play

![Character Showcase II](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/CharacterShowcaseII.gif)

## No. 07 - Midscreen I
Now that we've covered the more basic concepts for a character's toolkit, we can now move on to where our combos are. To start them off, we'll go with two midscreen routes that work just about anywhere.

![Midscreen I](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/MidscreenI.gif)

## No. 08 - Midscreen II
Similar to Midscreen I, Midscreen II is an easier route that will generally work just about anywhere.

![Midscreen II](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/MidscreenII.gif)

## No. 09 - Corner I
With different stage positioning, such as facing the corner, characters are often given much more combo ability to extend their usual routes. Corner I is an easier route to showcase the unique game state of corner-specific routes.

![Corner I](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/CornerI.gif)

## No. 10 - Corner II
Similar to Corner I, Corner II is an easier route that will only work in the corner.

![Corner II](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/CornerII.gif)

## No. 11 - Defensive Options
As a short break for more complex trials, these trials will showcase the defensive tools that a character can use. These tools are their Furious Action(aka Dragon Punch, "DP"), Guard Cancel & Guard Cancel Evasive Action, Reversal Burst, & Reversal Supers, where applicable.

![Defensive Options](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/DefenseiveOptions.gif)

## No. 12 - Metered Throw
Depending on the character, you may be required to spend meter to extend a landed throw into a combo. This metered extension can be in the form of an SP move or a One More Cancel, a rapid cancel that removes the recovery from another move. To universalize the route, characters that don't require meter to extend the combo will use the meter to finish the route.

![Metered Throw](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/MeteredThrow.gif)

## No. 13 - Air to Air
When countering an opponent's aerial approach, it's often good to react with an aerial attack yourself. These routes will showcase how you can confront this aerial approach with an aerial ladder or with a grounded combo route on a Counter Hit.

![Air to Air](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/AirToAir.gif)

## No. 14 - Anti-Air
As the name implies, these trials are dedicated to using a grounded anti-air starter. This is a good countermeasure to have against aerial opponents as the reward can be rather beneficial due to the typically stronger combo starter. 

![Anti_Air](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/Anti-Air.gif)

## No. 15 - All Out Attack(Launch)
Using the game's universal overhead attack, All Out Attack, we can showcase combo routes to both follow-ups. This trial is dedicated to the Launch variant, which sends the opponent into the air after pressing the 'C' button. Thus, allowing for an aerial ladder route.

![All Out Attack(Launch)](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/AllOutAttack(Launch).gif)

## No. 16 - All Out Attack(Blowback)
As previously explained, the game's universal overhead attack, All Out Attack, has two different follow-ups. This trial is dedicated to the Blowback variant, which sends the opponent back from where you hit them. When landing this starter in the corner, you can get a full combo after timing the Blowback hit correctly to force a Fatal Counter.

![All Out Attack(Blowback)](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/AllOutAttack(Blowback).gif)

## No. 17 - Midscreen III
After covering most of the basics, we can now showcase more difficult, yet more damaging, combo routes to showcase more of a character's toolkit. Next, we'll continue with two midscreen routes that work just about anywhere.

![Midscreen III](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/MidscreenIII.gif)

## No. 18 - Midscreen IV
Similar to Midscreen III, Midscreen IV is a more difficult, but more rewarding, route that will generally work just about anywhere.

![Midscreen IV](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/MidscreenIV.gif)

## No. 19 - Corner III
Similar to the previously explored corner-specific routing in Corner I & II, Corner III & IV will do the same with more difficult, yet more damaging routes. These routes will only work in the corner due to their interaction with the stage's wall.

![Corner III](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/CornerIII.gif)

## No. 20 - Corner IV
Similar to Corner III, Corner IV is a more difficult, but more rewarding, route that will only work in the corner.

![Corner IV](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/CornerIV.gif)

## No. 21 - Forced Fatal I
When landing a Counter hit against an opponent, the state of the Counter can be altered based on a few different things. The first of which is the initial attack used to begin the combo. Some moves have the property to force a Fatal Counter, which will then add extra hitstun and new combo links. The second is the status ailment of Fear, which allows for a Fatal Counter on any hit regardless of the attack being a proper Counter hit. And for the third, is what's known as a Fatal Recovery, but we'll explain this further later on.

![Forced Fatal I](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/ForcedFatalI.gif)

## No. 22 - Forced Fatal II
As previously mentioned, a Fatal Counter can also be performed on any hit when the opponent is inflicted with Fear. For the few characters that have access to this status ailment, they can use it to start an incredibly high damage route.

![Forced Fatal II](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/21e0bc83d405731a8d426de4a00d79b8d80c4dad/Trial%20Demos/ForcedFatalII.gif)

## No. 23 - Fatal Recovery
And finally the third method of inflicting a Fatal Counter, Fatal Recovery. This Fatal Counter is set by attacking an opponent during an attack that has a Fatal Recovery property, including the recovery. An easy example of a move with this type of recovery applied to it is Narukami's Raging Lion(214 + A/B). The reason this move has the property tied to it is that it is a very fast and safe offensive tool, where it will often open up the defense of an opponent.

![Fatal Recovery](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/FatalRecovery.gif)

## No. 24 - Self-Awakening
When a character is brought down to 35% HP or lower, they will enter a state called Awakening. This additionally gives them access to 1-2 SP Moves, a 50 meter bonus, & increased defenses, as a means to make a comeback possible regardless of the opponent's life lead. With the right combo routing, characters can take advantage of the bonus meter & unlocked supers from Awakening & make a strong comeback. These trials will show ways to deplete one's own HP enough to Self-Awaken and take advantage of Awakening's several bonuses.

![Self-Awakening](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/Self-Awakening.gif)

## No. 25 - Challenge!
As the name implies, these trials are dedicated to testing what a player has learned about a character's toolkit to come up with a combo that meets the set requirements. In example, these requirements could be using a certain move multiple times within the combo or meeting a damage/hit count threshold based on the character's toolkit. But ultimately, these are the final test for the Normal-type characters within the roster.

![Challenge!](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/Challenge!.gif)

## No. 26 - Meter Build
From trial 26 onwards, these routes are dedicated to the game's Shadow-type characters. These characters are defined by their Shadow Frenzy mechanic that depletes their meter on a timer while allowing them to perform an inescapable combo, chain special moves from one to another, and jump cancel all of their normal attacks. The cost for them doing this is that if the combo is dropped, they will lose all of their meter & Burst. Thus creating a hyper-offensive gameplan, where one combo should be all it takes to defeat their opponent. So, to start their trials, we begin with a combo dedicated to building as much meter as possible to be able to enter Frenzy with enough meter on the next combo.

![Meter Build](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/MeterBuild.gif)

## No. 27 - Shadow Frenzy I
As you could probably guess, the next few trials are dedicated to showcasing Shadow-type characters' Frenzy combos. In doing so, these trials will demonstrate a variety of situations where you can apply the unique properties of Shadow Frenzy to further extend a combo.

![Shadow Frenzy I](https://cdn.githubraw.com/Karasu456/P4U2R-Challenge-Mode-Plus/0b6ebba66141bb3516fd3ace50456bc1cdb89bfa/Trial%20Demos/ShadowFrenzyI.gif)

## No. 28 - Shadow Frenzy II

## No. 29 - Shadow Frenzy III

## No. 30 - Challenge!
As the name implies, these trials are dedicated to testing what a player has learned about a Shadow-type character's toolkit to come up with a combo that meets the set requirements. In example, these requirements could be using a certain move multiple times within the combo or meeting a damage/hit count threshold based on the character's toolkit. But ultimately, these are the final test for the Shadow-type characters within the roster.
